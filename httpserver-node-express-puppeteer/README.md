# Puppeteer HTTP Server

This guide shows you how to use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control browsers, including the option to run them headless (no UI).

To run it, follow these steps:

1. Install the CLI and a container runtime engine, for example [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
   Use the [unikraft CLI](https://unikraft.com/docs/cli/unikraft) or the legacy [kraft CLI](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli/install).

2. Clone the [`examples` repository](https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples) and `cd` into the `examples/httpserver-node-express-puppeteer/` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples
cd examples/httpserver-node-express-puppeteer/
```

Make sure to log into Unikraft Cloud and pick a [metro](https://unikraft.com/docs/platform/metros) close to you.
This guide uses `fra` (Frankfurt, 🇩🇪):

```bash title="unikraft"
unikraft login
```

or

```bash title="kraft"
# Set Unikraft Cloud access token
export UKC_TOKEN=token
# Set metro to Frankfurt, DE
export UKC_METRO=fra
```

The `UKC_TOKEN` and `UKC_METRO` environment variables are only supported by the legacy CLI.


> **Note:**
> A Puppeteer instance on Unikraft Cloud requires 4GB to run.
> Request an increase in the instance memory quota when you need more memory.

When done, invoke the following command to deploy this app on Unikraft Cloud:

```bash title="unikraft"
unikraft build . --output <my-org>/httpserver-node-express-puppeteer:latest
unikraft run --metro=fra -p 443:3000/tls+http -m 4G <my-org>/httpserver-node-express-puppeteer:latest
```

or

```bash title="kraft"
kraft cloud deploy -p 443:3000/tls+http -M 4G .
```

The output shows the instance address and other details:

```ansi

```

In this case, the instance name is `httpserver-node-express-puppeteer-7afg3`.
They're different for each run.

Use a browser to access the landing page of the Puppeteer (that uses [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)).
The app and the landing page are part of [this repository](https://github.com/christopher-talke/node-express-puppeteer-pdf-example).

In the example run above the landing page is at `https://nameless-fog-0tvh1uov.fra.unikraft.app`.
You can use the landing page to generate the PDF version of a remote page.

You can list information about the instance by running:

```bash
kraft cloud instance list httpserver-node-express-puppeteer-7afg3
```

```ansi
NAME                                     FQDN                                    STATE    STATUS       IMAGE                                  MEMORY   VCPUS  ARGS                               BOOT TIME

```

When done, you can remove the instance:

```bash title="unikraft"
unikraft instances delete httpserver-node-express-puppeteer-7afg3
```

or

```bash title="kraft"
kraft cloud instance remove httpserver-node-express-puppeteer-7afg3
```

## Customize your deployment

The current deployment uses an ExpressJS service that uses the [PDF generating functionality of Puppeteer](https://devdocs.io/puppeteer/).
Customizing the deployment means updating the service, such as adding new functionalities provided by Puppeteer.
You can update the service to provide a REST-like interface.
